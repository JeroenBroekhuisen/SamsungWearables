# Samsung Wearables
Scripts to create a tidy dataset of the mean values per activity / subject for the course Getting and Cleaning Data

The script required to process the Samsung Wearables data from downloading the file towards a tidy data set with the mean per activity, per subject. The script requires an internet connection as it starts with downloading the Samsung data from the website. Secondly it requires the package "dplyr" which has been used on several occasions during the course.

The repository contains the following files:
README.md - This file
run_analysis.R - The script to go from downloading the source data all the way to a tidy data set called MeanData
Mean Data Wearables.txt - The final result, the tidy data set
CodeBook.md - A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that was performed to clean up the data
